Fancy JSON
===============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smuldr/fancy-json.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/smuldr/fancy-json)

Android app that loads JSON data from a server and displays it in a pretty format.

Which JSON are you talking about?
-------------------------------

I use the aptly named [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) service because I am too lazy to maintain a backend service of my own.

The app first requests a list of "post" objects, after which you can drill down and see the post details along with a list of comments.

Pre-requisites
-------------------------------

- Android SDK v25
- Android Build Tools v25.0.0
- Android Support Repository r39
